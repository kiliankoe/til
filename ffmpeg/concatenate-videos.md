# Concatenate Video Files

Concating several video files with ffmpeg is very straightforward if they all share the same container and codec.

Add all input files to a text file listing their relative or absolute paths.

```
file 'file1.mp4'
file 'file2.mp4'
...
```

Run the following.

```sh
$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4
```

`-safe 0` can be omitted if the filepaths are relative.
